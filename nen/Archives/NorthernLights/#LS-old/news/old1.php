<b>New sky event day - 10.11.2007</b>
<p>
Seems that tuesday wasn't good day for everyone so we're going to pick new one.
Added poll to forums, at sky section, so everyone can vote what would be the best day. 
If we're going to do sky twice a week then we'll pick 2 days that got most votes.
</p>

<b>First event succesfully completed!</b>
<p>
Sky event went pretty good and was good start for LS. But that's really just a start.
<span id="over">From this on we will be doing sky events on tuesdays, same time, 17:00 (5PM) GMT.</span>
More information at forums.
</p>

<b>Forums added!</b>
<p>
Finally - <a href="http://blankpace.net/nlights/forum/">forums</a>! Registeration 
shouldn't need any validation or stuff like that.
So just register and start posting. I might change it so I or moderators need to 
activate account after registering, so we don't get outsiders posting there.
</p>
<p>
Added rules, might post that to forum too. Only sky rules there for now, 
and we might need to tweak it a little but that will mainly be it.
</p>

<b>New server and domain</b>
<p>
Now we have the server and this will be the address if anyone doesn't have
anything against it. I don't have any test coming soon so I have time to
update the sites and other stuff now. I'll add forums as soon as possible, 
shouldn't take more than few days at most.
</p>
<p>
And sky farming at friday evening, 5:00PM GMT. If time isn't good you can
suggest something else for upcoming events. I'll update info about point system
sometime soon.
</p>
<br />

<b>Start</b>
<p>
I uploaded sites to net. Sites are in early beta state or whatever. So if you
have any suggestions about colors or other stuff /tell me (Cuogar) in game.
</p>
<p>
I'll add forums and some other stuff like gallery and
maybe chat, and what ever we'll need.
</p>
