<b>Updates updates - 12. December 2007</b>
<p>
First of all, please use your in-game name when you register to forums. I would 
like to keep registeration open for everyone, but bots tend to be problem 
everywhere these days. So if you use your in-game name it's easier to see if you're 
bot or not.
</p>
<p>
Updated sky rules, now it should be fair for everyone. For latest updates check
the forums everyone now and then, those are easier to update so up-to-date info
will be there first. Salvage is on wednesdays 5PM GMT.

<b>Updated some stuff - 12. November 2007</b>
<p>
Updated rules a little, sky days are tuesday 6:00PM GMT and saturday 3:00PM GMT. You can
now see you points at forum, under sky section. Also I added ranks to forum, you
gain those by posting.
</p>
<p>
Delrith was planning to do Promys and/or ArkAngels at weekend, so it would be
saturday evening or sunday. And also at least one of us needed sky I think, so
we should get it someday but it shouldn't take long. Oh btw, if you use IRC
join #ffxi.northernlights @ QuakeNet.
