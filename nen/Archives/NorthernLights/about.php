<strong>Information</strong>:
<p>
NorthernLights is GMT end-game linkshell for EU players on Cerberus. Linkshell is
pretty new and still growing, our goal is to get at least 40 active members.
To get in the linkshell you need just one job over level 70 and you need access to sky.
Since we're doing pretty much everything you can't have any other end-game linkshells, to 
prevent complications. Also new members should post some information about themselves to forums.
</p>

<strong>Events</strong>:
<p>
We are doing pretty much everything end-game related stuff. And the more we get members
the bigger events we can arrange, like dynamis. Right now we're doing sky two times a week and
salvage once a week. HNMs every now and then too.
