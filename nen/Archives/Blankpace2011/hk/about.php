<h2>History and now</h2>
<p>
I was born in small town called <a href="http://www.lieksa.fi/">Lieksa</a> in eastern Finland.
I grew up and went to school there. After my military service on 2007 I moved to <a href="http://www.riihimaki.fi/">Riihimäki</a>.
</p>
<p>
Currently I'm studying media technology at <a href="http://www.hamk.fi/">HAMK</a> University of 
Applied Sciences in Riihimäki. If everything goes as planned I should
graduate on 2011 as engineer of media technology.

<p>
I listen music, a lot. Everything from metal to classic, except punk. 
Also I play guitar every now and then, and also used to do some music 
but these days I hardly find time for it.
</p>

<p>
I like programming a lot and that's what I currently study too.
Especially I'm interested on game development.
My current project(s) can be found here: <a href="works/wip/main">WIP projects</a>
</p>

<p>
I like watching series and movies. Favourite is fantasy and scifi, 
but for those too, scale is pretty large.
I don't do much reading but I've read few fantasy books.
