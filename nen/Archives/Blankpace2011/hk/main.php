<h1>My homepage</h1>

<div id="floatbox">
<?php include('updates/box.php'); ?>
</div>

<p>
These are my homepages. You can find here some information about me and 
stuff I've done. <br />
I've made several pages before these, but these are first pages uploaded
to internet. These pages are made mostly to show the things I'm good at but also
to learn more about developing web pages.
</p>
<p>
From About page you can find little more info about me. CV is my curriculum vitae, 
which I try to keep up-to-date. Works section includes work samples and everything 
else I've done and is worth showing.
</p>
<p>
Pages are fully handwritten, with text editor called 
<a href="http://www.pspad.com">PSPad</a>. Image editing is done with <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.
This page is valid XHTML 1.0 Strict and CSS is valid too. I used PHP a little to 
make site easier to update.
