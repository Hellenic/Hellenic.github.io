						<strong>Name:</strong> Hannu Antero K&auml;rkk&auml;inen<br />
						<strong>Age:</strong> 20<br />
						<strong>Nick:</strong> Hellenic<br />
						<strong>MSN:</strong> hellenic(at)blankpace.net<br />

						<p><strong>About me:</strong><br />
						I was born in <a href="http://www.lieksa.fi">Lieksa</a>. It is a 
						little place at eastern Finland. I grew up and went to school there.
						</p>
						<p>
						Currently I'm studying media technology in HAMK University of 
						Applied Sciences on Riihimäki. If everything goes as planned I should
						graduate on 2011 as engineer of media technology.
						</p>
						
						<p><strong>Hobbies:</strong><br />
						I listen music a lot, rock/metal is my favourite but 
						I listen almost everything, except punk. 
						Long time ago I made music myself and played guitar.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						I like watching anime and movies. Favourite is fantasy and that 
						kind of stuff, but for those too, scale is pretty large.
						I don't do much reading but I've read some manga and
						few fantasy books.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						I also do some 3D-modeling. I'm not too good at it (yet), 
						but I am eager to learn more. You can check some of my renders
						at <a href="cgi/index.html">CGI</a>-page.<br />
						I've teached myself HTML and CSS, and now I have those at
						school too.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						I play a little too, mostly role-playing games (RPG). Right now my 
						playing is mostly with Final Fantasy XI MMORPG. I've also
						tried out World of Warcraft and many many other MMORPGs, but
						still I find FFXI most interesting.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Unfortunately, sports have smallest part on my hobbies. But still 
						I go swimming every now and then. And at least I walk to school
						so I get some fresh air that way.
