Currently I'm studying media technology at HAMK University of Applied Sciences in Riihimäki. I like programming a lot and that's what I currently study too. Especially I'm interested on game development.
I'm always up for new challenges! If you have a job that could use the skills I have feel free to contact me. I'm especially interested about summer / evening / weekend jobs.
