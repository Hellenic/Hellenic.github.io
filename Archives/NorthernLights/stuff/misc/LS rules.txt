Everyone puts up comment what they want to lot, if they have or will get enough points to lot.
Probably more than one people will lot the same item, so person who gets the item will lose 5 points.
Others who lot the same item and didn't get it will not lose points.

one should spend at least 1 hour farming to get 2 points from it.

Dynamis:
LS pays the hourglass and will lot for coins.
Coins will be sold and put to LS bank for future hourglass purchases and for other costs.
If LS bank is running low, we will do city runs because those should drop more coins.
If there are more money in bank than we need we can split it between members.
