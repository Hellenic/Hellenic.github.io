<b>The end - 12th February 2008</b>
<p>
This seems to be the end of this linkshell...<br />
We had some good runs and even few times we had full alliance on sky.
At least we got some nice experience from sky and gods<br />
More info <a href="http://blankpace.net/nlights/forum/viewtopic.php?t=135">here</a>.

<b>Merry christmas and happy new year!</b>
<br />
<b>Sites updated - 21st December 2007</b>
<p>
New site made and uploaded...<br />
Maybe little better than last one, maybe not =P
</p>
<p>
Forums registeration has been changed because of bots. Now administrator has to
activate every account before they can post anything, this keeps bots from posting
advertisements. In a mean while real users can introduce themselves in 
recruitment forum.<br />
<strong>Merry christmas for everyone!</strong>
</p>
<br />

<b>Updates updates - 12th December 2007</b>
<p>
First of all, please use your in-game name when you register to forums. I would 
like to keep registeration open for everyone, but bots tend to be problem 
everywhere these days. So if you use your in-game name it's easier to see if you're 
bot or not.

Updated sky rules, now it should be fair for everyone. For latest updates check
the forums everyone now and then, those are easier to update so up-to-date info
will be there first. Salvage is on wednesdays 5PM GMT.
</p>
<br />

<b>Updated some stuff - 12th November 2007</b>
<p>
Updated rules a little, sky days are tuesday 6:00PM GMT and saturday 3:00PM GMT. You can
now see you points at forum, under sky section. Also I added ranks to forum, you
gain those by posting.

Delrith was planning to do Promys and/or ArkAngels at weekend, so it would be
saturday evening or sunday. And also at least one of us needed sky I think, so
we should get it someday but it shouldn't take long. Oh btw, if you use IRC
join #ffxi.northernlights @ QuakeNet.
