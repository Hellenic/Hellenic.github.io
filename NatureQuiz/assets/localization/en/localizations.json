For example, if picture of bear is shown to you, you need to type in 'bear'. You do not need to know if it's a grey bear or brown bear, so just 'bear' is enough.</p><p>To play Nature Quiz, on the main screen choose a category you want to play and click 'Play'. You will be shown pictures. For each picture you can try to type in the answer or you can choose to skip it.
